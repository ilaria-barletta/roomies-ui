# Roomies

Roomies is a website addressed to people sharing an household. If you have roommates and you need to take care of sharing rent and groceries, Roomies is for you. It is possible to create households, add members, keep track of the due rent and create grocery lists as well as assign items to specific housemates. They say sharing is hard, Roomies makes it easier.

# UX Design

 In Roomies my main goal was to build a useful and intuitive app that helps people to manage their household in a simple way. By using a series of buttons the user is allowed to perform actions like create households, add members to it, update rent payments, create grocery lists, add grocery items, assign the items to specific members and leave comments to the lists.The app is easy to navigate and to give a better experience to the user, it provides confirmation every time an action is performed letting the user  know if it's successfull or if an error occured.The user  will also receive details on how to fix such errors in order to proceed. The design picked here is minimal, the main image is a drawing of a household that I generated here : https://hotpot.ai/art-generator and that reflects the purpose of the app (a house shared by multiple people) making, in my opinion,  the scope of the app clear even before reading. 
## Navigation 

### Navigation Bar 
The navigation bar is minimal and for a non logged in user contains the name of the app and the sign in link that will take them to the form they need to fill in order to get access. Once the user is logged in the signed in link will also show the name of the user and will, if clicked, provide the option to sign out. To make it convenient for logged in users to get back to their main household when they are visiting different pages, for example if they are checking the grocery lists page, the `Roomies` site name link in the navigation bar will take them back to the page of their main household.

### Navigating to and from forms 
I have built this app so that all the main pages have a consistent structure regarding the style and the functionalities. This means that users will find it easy to use the various different parts of the app as they all look and behave in a consistent way. Household, grocery lists, grocery items and comments pages are all made of forms that the user needs to fill in order to create and update them. All pages have buttons that guide the user in their actions: `create`, `edit`, `delete`. Users are then able to either submit the form or go back to where they came from via a `back` button that is present on every from.
